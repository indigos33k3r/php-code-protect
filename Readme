Prerequisite
Php should be installed and accescibile from terminal

What this tool does
This tool encodes your php data in a header file which you can include in your cprogram and execute from C. This way you can hide your php business logic

Convert.php
The script takes 2 input . First arg is the php script filename which needs to be encoded.2nd argument is  the name of c header file which is created by the tool. You can run this tool like this
php convert.php example.php prog.h
 

There is Makefile.Which builds an application.Just run make and it should create prog.h and app after encoding example.php. main.c are easy enough to understand
