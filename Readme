Prerequisite
Php should be installed and accessible from terminal

What this tool does
This tool encodes and packages your php data in a header file which you can include in your c program and execute from within program. This way you can hide your php business logic

Convert.php
The script takes 2 input arguments. First arg is the php script filename which needs to be encoded and packaged. Second argument is  the name of c header file which is created by the tool. You can run this tool like this
php convert.php example.php prog.h
 

There is Makefile, which builds a demo application. Just run make and it should create prog.h and app after encoding example.php.
